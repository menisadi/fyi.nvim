## What is this?

A little plugin which randomly tells you about vim commands.

## Plan

The idea is to crate a little function which picks a random vim tip/command 
from a database (which will likely be, at first, just local and manually).
This function could than be used to provide those tips at the dashboard 
or just as a notification periodically / randomly.
